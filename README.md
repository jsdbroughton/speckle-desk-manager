# Speckle Desk Manager

Example project utlising [Speckle](https://github.com/specklesystems) to manage desk spaces and team planning for an organization.

## BÃ¼ro Speckle

BS is a fairly traditionally structured large architectural practice. With 200 employees working from the 2 adjacent office buildings, they have need of a way of managing their desk spaces organisation. When a project team shrinks, grows, begins or ends there is a grand reshuffle to make sure that eveyone is sitting near their team. They also need a way for everyone to find each other. A floating hot-desk offering is required to account for hybrid working.

In short they have a spatial data problem.

Speckle makes spatial data portable and accessible.
